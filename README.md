Library Management System (Java)

This document outlines a Java application for managing books and members in a library. It provides essential functionalities for librarians and members to streamline library operations.

Features:

    Book Management:
        Add new books with details like title, author, ISBN, genre, publication year, and availability status.
        Edit existing book information.
        Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
        View a list of all books in the library.
        Remove books from the system (mark as unavailable or permanently deleted).
    Member Management:
        Add new members, capturing information like name, contact details, library card number, and membership status (active, inactive).
        Edit existing member information.
        Search for members by name or library card number.
        View a list of all members in the library.
    Loan Management:
        Issue books to members, recording the loan date and due date.
        Return books, updating availability status and calculating any overdue charges (if applicable).
        View a list of currently borrowed books with details about borrowers and due dates.
        Search for borrowed books by member or book title.

Additional Considerations:

    User Interface (Optional): While a command-line interface (CLI) is a starting point, consider evolving towards a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX for a more user-friendly experience.
    Data Persistence: Explore storing library data (books, members, loans) in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for scalability and data persistence beyond program execution.
    Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage invalid user input, data access issues, and unexpected exceptions.
    Security: If user accounts and sensitive information are involved (like member details), consider incorporating authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure access.

Installation and Usage:

Prerequisites:

    Java Development Kit (JDK): Download and install the latest JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/.
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Optional): An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans can streamline development by providing code editing, debugging, and project management tools.

Building and Running the Application:

    Clone or download the source code for the library management system (instructions specific to the chosen repository or approach).
    Open the project in your IDE or use a text editor if working with individual Java files.
    Compile the Java code into an executable file using the javac command in your terminal (if using an IDE, this is typically handled automatically).
    Run the compiled application using the java command followed by the main class name (e.g., java LibraryManagementSystem).

User Interaction:

    The application will guide you through various menus to perform different library operations.
    Follow the on-screen prompts to add books, members, manage loans, and perform other relevant actions.
